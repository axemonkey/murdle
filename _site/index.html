		<p>Five boys at Leyton High School each took an exam in their favourite subject with their favourite teacher on the same day. No two students received the same grade, and no two students favoured the same subject. How did they do?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Neither Dr Malmsteen nor Mr Mustaine teach subjects that start with ‘M’</li>
			<li>Adrian hates chemistry as much as Steve loves French</li>
			<li>Dr Malmsteen’s favourite pupil is Bruce, and vice versa</li>
			<li>The student who had a maths exam that day was happy to get a ‘B’</li>
			<li>Nicko was not so happy when he read that his grade was an ‘E’</li>
			<li>Dave’s favourite teacher’s surname starts with ‘M’</li>
			<li>Leyton High’s music teacher is Mr Bettencourt</li>
			<li>Mrs Hammett was unwell when marking her exams, and just gave everyone a ‘C’</li>
			<li>Bruce’s favourite subject is History</li>
			<li>Dave’s grade was better than Nicko’s but worse than Adrian’s</li>
